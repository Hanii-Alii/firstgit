PRACTICING GIT!
I created a new folder named add.<br>
<h2>Version Control Operations:</h2>
<p> Firstly I initialised git in a folder with the git init command i.e (git init),
  then I added a file named sum,sum and mult for git tracking by command git add . to add all the untracked files in tracked.
  Then I commited it with the command commit -m "This is my first commit" for first change.      
 </p>       
<h2>Branching and Merging:</h2>
<p>For make a new branch I used the command git branch <branch_name>, I made a new branch of name new
 then I switched to that branch named new by "git checkout new" and then i worked on it. Now for merging 
I switched to the main branch by using git checkout main and then use the command git merge <branch_name> 
  which is new and merged the branches.<br>
</p>
<h2>GitHub Collaboration Simulation:</h2>
For pushing the code on git hub, I made a new repository on my git hub profile and then it shows me the command and link in order to push my code.<br>
git remote add origin https://github.com/Hanii-Alii/firstgit.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
through my local depository i pushed this code on git hub.
<h2>Commit Message Best Practices:</h2>
It is a message tha should be added in order to remind ourself about the changes the we have made on our code.<br>
